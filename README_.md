README is a documentation file that usually contains a plain text file. It is a documentation directory that contains your project description and information about your project.
  
README files are commonly created on VS Code and found in the root directory of a software project. The typical filename is always ‘README.md’, or ‘README.txt’ hosted on Git Hub.
  
The .md in Readme is a file extension for Markdown format used to create a lightweight plain-text document.
